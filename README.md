# Sparx-Enterprise-Architect-Wrapper
An easy to use C# interface to the Sparx Enterprise Architect API
This API is designed to be easy to use in terms of programming. The intention is to facilitate integration with other systems such as JIRA. So most of the API is about "Find or Create" or "Update".

Feedback is welcome.
